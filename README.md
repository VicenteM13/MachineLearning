Literally dont know what im doing just yet.<br>
Please hold.<br>
Additionally, if you are reading this and you are not me, then that means I forgot to revise this before making it public.<br>
But while I have you, please give me a job.<br>
I need one.<br>
I got a masters and everything.<br>
Also, why do so many entry level positions require experience?<br>
Am I seriously expected to do an internship??<br>
Internships are scams in my honest opinion.<br>
Alright well no ones probably gonna read this, so I shall take my leave now.<br>
Give me a job though.<br>
I'm dead serious.
