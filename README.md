Literally dont know what im doing just yet.
Please hold.
Additionally, if you are reading this and you are not me, then that means I forgot to revise this before making it public.
But while I have you, please give me a job. 
I need one.
I got a masters and everything.
Also, why do so many entry level positions require experience? 
Am I seriously expected to do an internship??
Internships are scams in my honest opinion.
Alright well no ones probably gonna read this, so I shall take my leave now.
Give me a job though.
I'm dead serious.
